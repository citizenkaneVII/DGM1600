It all starts when jack instead of joe kills bruces parents, and well, he hasn't been quite the same since...
He's uncomfortable in his own skin, which is why he has to go out at night and kick crime's butt.
Then he meet's jack again, drops him into movie liquid, and now jack ins't the same anymore.
I feel like this is one of the few times where Joker dosen't have a crush on Batman.
But he's still obsessed.
Batman kills him in the end, and pretty much everything that happens here is irrelivent in the next movie.
