/*Math opporators are used to perform caculations in a program.
The opporators used are:

+ to add/find sum
- to subtract/find difference
* to multiply/find product
/ to devide/find quotient
% modulus/to find remainder


 	A + B = 30
    A - B = -10
    A * B = 200
    B / A = 2
    B % A = 0

There is also ++ and -- which are used in loops.  These will either increse or decrese and interger by 1.

int a = 6;
int b = 3;
int result;
 
result = a + b;         // result = 9
result = a - b;         // result = 3
result = a * b;         // result = 18
result = a / b;         // result = 2
result = a + b - 1;     // result = 8
