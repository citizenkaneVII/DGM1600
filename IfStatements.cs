/*The Following are multple if/else statements I made when constructing a prision escape game.  Each if/else statement is triggered
by the player inputting a key choice that represents an action.  In the first state, we have three choices to pick from, all opporating on ifs
or else ifs.  Each one will enable us to go to a different state which will provide even more choices provided by if/else statements.*/
