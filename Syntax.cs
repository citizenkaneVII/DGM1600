//Syntax Assignment and conventions

/*When coding, syntax is important because it helps everyone involved be able to read and understand the code.
With out this, programing because difficult to do. */

the code, and help us to know what the code does.

Two ways of declaring code is (//) and (/*)
 
 
 The first // will reserve one line for comments.  Upon pressing the enter/return key, the line will end
 and code will be written.  Example:*/
